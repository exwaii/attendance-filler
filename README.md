# attendance filler

touch up of an automated school attendance google forms filler i used during online learning in 2020.

normally to submit to a google form POST to forms/d/e/formid/formResponse is enough, however this form required you to be logged into your education email account, which took me a while to get around.

eventually used selenium to headlessly log in every time and submit a prefilled form. this is probably very bad practice, but i made this in y9.

here's a video of an automated submission without --headless option.
